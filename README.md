#DRIP Asset Allocation

**v2.34**  *29 September 2016*

DRIP Asset Allocation aims to collect model libraries for portfolio theory, Black Litterman Strategy Incorporator, Holdings Constraint, and Transaction Costs Modeling.

DRIP Asset Allocation is composed of four main model libraries:
 * MPT Framework Model Library
 * Black Litterman Model Library
 * Holdings Constraint Model Library
 * Transaction Cost Model Library

For Installation, Documentation and Samples, please check out [DRIP] (https://github.com/lakshmiDRIP/DRIP).
